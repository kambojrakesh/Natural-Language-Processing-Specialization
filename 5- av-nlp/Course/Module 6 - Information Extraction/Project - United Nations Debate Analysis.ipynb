Forty-seven years ago this month the war was finally over, and \\nI was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest: \\n1945 marked a moment of promise, not just for me, but for all of mankind. A \\ngreat struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won. Across the \\nglobe, we all looked forward to a future free of war, a world where we might \\nraise our children in peace and freedom, and this institution, the United \\nNations, born amidst the ashes of war, embodied those hopes and dreams like no \\nother. \\nBut the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist \\nimperialism divided the world in two, our hopes for peace and our dreams of \\nfreedom were frozen in the grip of cold war, and, instead of finding a common \\nground, we found ourselves at Ground Zero. Instead of living on Churchill\\'s \\nThe President returned to the Chair. \\n\\n\"broad, sunlit uplands\", millions found that there was, as Arthur Koestler so \\nchillingly wrote, \"Darkness at Noon\". Instead of uniting the nations, this \\nbody became a forum for distrust and division among nations and, in a cruel \\nirony, the United Nations, created to free the world of conflict, itself \\nbecame conflict\\'s captive. \\nI too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit, proudly so; I \\nserved in this Assembly and I saw, in my time, the consequences of the cold \\nwar\\'s hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations. Now, 47 years \\nlater, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and \\ndreams have awakened again. Driven by its own internal contradictions and \\nbanished by the peoples\\' undying thirst for freedom, imperial communism has \\ncollapsed in its birthplace, and today Russia has awakened democratic, \\nindependent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine, \\nArmenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the \\nnations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom. \\nThe fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super-Powers has vanished, and \\nwe are proud to have done our part to ensure that our schoolchildren do not \\nhave to practise hiding under their desks for fear of nuclear attack, as the \\ngeneration before them did. I am proud also to salute the courageous leaders \\nwith nuclear responsibilities Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Nazarbayev, \\nShushkevich who joined me in ending the super-Power stand-off that risked \\nnuclear nightmare. This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as \\ntruly independent and free nations, and to you and the leaders of the other \\nindependent States, I say welcome home: we are now truly united nations. \\n\\nWith the cold war\\'s end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to go \\nbeyond artificial divisions of a first, second and third world to forge \\ninstead a genuine, global community of free and sovereign nations, a community \\nbuilt on respect for principle, on peaceful settlement of disputes, on \\nfundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and \\nfree markets. Already, the United Nations, especially the Security Council, \\nhas done much to fulfil its original mission and to build this global \\ncommunity. \\nUnited Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and \\nbrokering peace the entire world over, but securing democracy and securing the \\npeace in the century ahead will be no simple task. Imperial communism may \\nhave been vanquished, but that does not end the challenges of our age, \\nchallenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions \\nbetween East and West, North and South, that fuel strife and strain and \\nconflict and war. \\nAs we support the historic growth of democracy around the world, I \\nbelieve the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical, \\ninterrelated challenges as we enter the twenty-first century. \\nFirst, we face the political challenge of keeping today\\'s peace and \\npreventing tomorrow\\'s wars. As we see daily in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia, \\neverywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace-keeping \\ncapabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have \\nnever been more intractable, the costs of conflict higher. \\nSecond, we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons \\nof mass destruction, truly the fastest growing security challenge to \\ninternational peace and order. \\n\\nThird, we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for \\nall, of strengthening an open, growth-oriented, free-market international \\neconomic order while safeguarding the environment. \\nMeeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective \\nengagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and, \\nabove all, it will require that each of us look seriously at our own \\nGovernment and how we conduct our international affairs. We too must change \\nour institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the \\npromises of today, if we are to secure a twenty-first century peace. \\n \\nWith you today I would like to discuss these three challenges: \\npeace-keeping, proliferation and prosperity. And I should like to use this \\nopportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can \\nwork together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is \\nchanging its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort. \\nLet me begin with peace-keeping. The United Nations has a long and \\ndistinguished history of peace-keeping and humanitarian relief. From Cyprus \\nand Lebanon, to Cambodia and Croatia, the blue beret has become a symbol of \\nhope amid all that hostility. And the United Nations has long played a \\ncentral role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars, and strengthening \\npeace-keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts. But, \\nas much as the United Nations has done, it can do much more. \\nPeace-keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their \\nservices increase by the day. The need for monitoring and preventive \\npeace-keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts - may \\nbecome especially critical in volatile regions. This is especially the case \\nbecause of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern \\nEurope and Eurasia. Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron \\ncurtain, peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen \\nin communism\\'s catacomb. \\nWhere this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and \\ncivility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, this new \\ndemocratic nationalism is all to the good. But, unfortunately, we need only \\nlook to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to \\nsee the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the \\ndemocratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and \\n \\nEurasia, even more than economic deprivation. We fully support the efforts of \\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Conference on Security and \\nCooperation in Europe (CSCE), the Western European Union (WEU), the \\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and other competent regional \\norganizations to develop peace-keeping capabilities. \\nWe are convinced, however, that enhanced United Nations capabilities are \\na necessary complement to these regional efforts, not just in Europe and \\nEurasia, but across the globe. \\nI welcome the Secretary-General\\'s call for a new agenda to strengthen the \\nability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across \\nthe globe. Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to \\nadvance that agenda. I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the \\nmerits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the \\nSecretary-General\\'s proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key \\nareas. \\nFirst, robust peace-keeping requires men and equipment that only Member \\nStates can provide. Nations should develop and train military units for \\npossible peace-keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces \\nmust be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and \\nwith the approval, of course, of the Governments providing it. \\nSecondly, if multinational units are to work together, they must train \\ntogether. Many nations for example, Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have \\na long history of peace-keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we \\ntrain for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also \\nrequire coordinated command and control and inter-operability of both \\nequipment and communications. Multinational planning, training, field \\n\\nexercises will be needed. Those efforts should link up with regional \\norganizations. \\nThirdly, we also need to provide adequate logistical support for \\npeace-keeping and humanitarian operations. Member States should designate \\nstockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies, including \\nfamines, floods and civil disturbances. This will save valuable time in a \\ncrisis. \\nFourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and \\nintelligence capabilities for peace-keeping and humanitarian operations. \\nFifthly, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations \\nand associated peace-keeping efforts. \\nAs I said, we must change our national institutions if we are to change \\nour international relations. So let me assure you that the United States is \\nready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international \\npeace-keeping. \\nFor decades, the American military has served as a stabilizing presence \\naround the globe. And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning \\nwars, in keeping the peace, to support United Nations peace-keeping. I have \\ndirected the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on \\npeace-keeping. Because of peace-keeping\\'s growing importance as a mission for \\nthe United States military, we will emphasize training of combat, engineering \\nand logistical units for the full range of peace-keeping and humanitarian \\nactivities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our \\nconsiderable lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to \\nsupport peace-keeping operations. And we will offer our capabilities for \\njoint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint \\npeace-keeping operations. \\n\\nThere is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will \\nplay a part. \\nMember States, as always, must retain the final decision on the use of \\ntheir troops, of course. But we must develop our ability to coordinate \\npeace-keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace \\narises or when people in need look to the world for help. \\nI have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace-keeping \\ncurriculum in United States military schools. Training, plainly, is a key \\nelement. The United States is prepared to make available our bases and \\nfacilities for multinational training and field exercises. One such base, \\nnearby, with facilities is Fort Dix. America used these bases to win the cold \\nwar and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace. \\nThe United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the \\nUnited Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and \\noperations for peace-keeping, and we will also broaden American support for \\nmonitoring, verification, reconnaissance and other requirements of United \\nNations peace-keeping or humanitarian assistance operations. \\nAnd, finally, the United States will review how we fund peace-keeping and \\nexplore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United \\nNations peace-keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities. I do \\nbelieve that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our \\nsecurity in this new era. \\nWhile the cold war may have ended, the super-Power nuclear arms \\ncompetition, regional competition, weapons of mass destruction continue. Over \\n20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons \\n \\nand the means to deliver them. At a time when the United States and its \\nformer adversaries are engaged in deep, historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals, \\nour children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and \\nunstable nuclear stand-offs to develop around the world. \\n\\nWe believe the Security Council should become a key forum for \\nnon-proliferation enforcement. The Security Council should make clear its \\nintention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators. Reaffirming \\nassurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \\nWeapons was negotiated, I propose that the Security Council reassure the \\nnon-nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance, \\nin accordance with the Charter, to any any non-nuclear-weapon State party to \\nthe non-proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an \\nobject of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons. \\nI also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non-proliferation \\nTreaty when it is reviewed in 1995. I believe we must explore ways we can \\nstrengthen linkages between the suppliers \"clubs\", the nuclear-suppliers \\ngroup, the Australia Group, the missile-technology control regime and United \\nNations specialized agencies. \\nHere I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations \\nSpecial Commission (UNSCOM) to dismantle the Iraqi weapons-of-mass-destruction \\nprogramme, and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy \\nAgency (IAEA). But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop \\nproliferation, so too must every Member State change its structures to advance \\nour non-proliferation goals. \\nIn that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the \\nUnited States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and \\nDisarmament Agency (ACDA) to refocus its talents on providing technical \\nsupport for non-proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global \\ndefence conversion. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, ACDA \\n\\nshould be used not only in completing the traditional arms-control agenda but, \\njust as importantly, in providing technical assistance on our new security \\nagenda. \\nEven as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \\nwe must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already \\ntaking place. Therefore, we are working towards a cooperative system for \\ndefence against limited ballistic missile attacks. We fully intend to have \\nother nations participate in this global protection system. \\nWhile expanded peace-keeping capabilities and improved non-proliferation \\nefforts will be critical for building an enduring peace, shared economic \\ngrowth is the long-term foundation for a brighter future well into the next \\ncentury. That is why I stated yesterday, during a moment of international \\nuncertainty, that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global \\npartners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for \\nthis new era. \\nAt the same time, I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to \\nexamine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven (G-7) coordination process, and \\nI affirmed America\\'s support for a European integration that opens markets and \\nenhances Europe\\'s capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we \\nface in this new era. While the exact form of integration is, of course, for \\nEuropeans to determine, we will stand by them. \\nEconomic growth is not a zero-sum process. All of us will benefit from \\nthe expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world \\neconomy. To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared \\nby all, fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic \\n\\nengine. That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of \\nthe negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as \\nsoon as possible, and to create a network of free-trade agreements, beginning \\nwith the North American Free Trade Agreement. \\nAt the same time, we need to recognize that we have a shared \\nresponsibility to foster and support the free-market reforms necessary to \\nbuild growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in \\nthe new democratic States. This should be done by promoting the private \\nsector to build these new economies, not by fostering dependency with \\ntraditional Government-to-Government foreign aid. \\nAfter the Second World War, foreign assistance often served as a weapon \\nin the cold war. Obviously, we will still use critical foreign-assistance \\nfunds to meet legitimate security needs. And, as our humanitarian operations \\nin Somalia and northern Iraq, Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify, \\nwe will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those \\nsuffering from man-made and natural disasters. \\nBut foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion \\nof the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation \\nand mutually productive economic relationships. We know this: the more a \\nnation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of \\ngrowth; the more open to trade it is, the higher its rate of growth; and the \\nbetter a country\\'s investment climate, the higher its rate of growth. \\nTo move from what I would call aid-dependency to economic partnership, we \\npropose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance \\nprogrammes to building strong, independent economies that can become \\n\\ncontributors to a healthy, growing global economy. That means that our new \\nemphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors \\nthat will promote prosperity at home, and abroad also. Working with our \\nCongress I will propose a top-to-bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan \\nand administer foreign assistance, drastically reducing the bureaucracy that \\nhas built up around Government-based programmes, streamlining our delivery \\nsystems and strengthening support for private-sector development and economic \\nreform. \\nThe Agency for International Development (AID), another institution born \\nduring the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled. \\nPromoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a \\nprimary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be \\ncharity. On the contrary, they should promote mutual prosperity. Therefore, \\nusing existing foreign-affairs resources, I will propose creating a $1 billion \\ngrowth fund. The fund will provide grants and credits to support United \\nStates businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately \\nneeded in countries undertaking economic restructuring. \\nI will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the \\nExport-Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology \\npromote investment in world-wide economic growth. \\nThe United States will work with its global partners, especially the G-7 \\nnations, to enhance global growth at this key point in world history, as we \\nend one era and begin another. \\nNone of us can afford insular policies. Each of us must contribute, \\nthrough greater coordinated action, to building ¬£ stronger world economy. \\n\\nI realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda. But we \\nlive in remarkable times: times when empires collapse, ideologies dissolve \\nand walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget \\nhow far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global \\ncommunity of democratic nations. \\n\\nAnd in the face of today\\'s changes, with the loss of so much that was \\nfamiliar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people \\neverywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against \\ntrade, walls against people, walls against ideas and investment, walls against \\nanything at all that appears new and different. \\nAs the Berlin Wall fell, these walls too must fall.

Forty seven years ago this month the war was finally over, and  I was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest:  1945 marked a moment of promise, not just for me, but for all of mankind. A  great struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won. Across the  globe, we all looked forward to a future free of war, a world where we might  raise our children in peace and freedom, and this institution, the United  Nations, born amidst the ashes of war, embodied those hopes and dreams like no  other.  But the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist  imperialism divided the world in two, our hopes for peace and our dreams of  freedom were frozen in the grip of cold war, and, instead of finding a common  ground, we found ourselves at Ground Zero. Instead of living on Churchill  The President returned to the Chair.   broad, sunlit uplands, millions found that there was, as Arthur Koestler so  chillingly wrote, Darkness at Noon. Instead of uniting the nations, this  body became a forum for distrust and division among nations and, in a cruel  irony, the United Nations, created to free the world of conflict, itself  became conflict captive.  I too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit, proudly so; I  served in this Assembly and I saw, in my time, the consequences of the cold  war hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations. Now, 47 years  later, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and  dreams have awakened again. Driven by its own internal contradictions and  banished by the peoples' undying thirst for freedom, imperial communism has  collapsed in its birthplace, and today Russia has awakened democratic,  independent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine,  Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the  nations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom.  The fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super Powers has vanished, and  we are proud to have done our part to ensure that our schoolchildren do not  have to practise hiding under their desks for fear of nuclear attack, as the  generation before them did. I am proud also to salute the courageous leaders  with nuclear responsibilities Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Nazarbayev,  Shushkevich who joined me in ending the super Power stand off that risked  nuclear nightmare. This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as  truly independent and free nations, and to you and the leaders of the other  independent States, I say welcome home: we are now truly united nations.   With the cold war end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to go  beyond artificial divisions of a first, second and third world to forge  instead a genuine, global community of free and sovereign nations, a community  built on respect for principle, on peaceful settlement of disputes, on  fundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and  free markets. Already, the United Nations, especially the Security Council,  has done much to fulfil its original mission and to build this global  community.  United Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and  brokering peace the entire world over, but securing democracy and securing the  peace in the century ahead will be no simple task. Imperial communism may  have been vanquished, but that does not end the challenges of our age,  challenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions  between East and West, North and South, that fuel strife and strain and  conflict and war.  As we support the historic growth of democracy around the world, I  believe the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical,  interrelated challenges as we enter the twenty first century.  First, we face the political challenge of keeping today peace and  preventing tomorrow wars. As we see daily in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia,  everywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace keeping  capabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have  never been more intractable, the costs of conflict higher.  Second, we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons  of mass destruction, truly the fastest growing security challenge to  international peace and order.   Third, we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for  all, of strengthening an open, growth oriented, free market international  economic order while safeguarding the environment.  Meeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective  engagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and,  above all, it will require that each of us look seriously at our own  Government and how we conduct our international affairs. We too must change  our institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the  promises of today, if we are to secure a twenty first century peace.  With you today I would like to discuss these three challenges:  peace keeping, proliferation and prosperity. And I should like to use this  opportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can  work together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is  changing its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort.  Let me begin with peace keeping. The United Nations has a long and  distinguished history of peace keeping and humanitarian relief. From Cyprus  and Lebanon, to Cambodia and Croatia, the blue beret has become a symbol of  hope amid all that hostility. And the United Nations has long played a  central role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars, and strengthening  peace keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts. But,  as much as the United Nations has done, it can do much more.  Peace keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their  services increase by the day. The need for monitoring and preventive  peace keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts   may  become especially critical in volatile regions. This is especially the case  because of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern  Europe and Eurasia. Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron  curtain, peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen  in communism catacomb.  Where this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and  civility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, this new  democratic nationalism is all to the good. But, unfortunately, we need only  look to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to  see the dangers of ethnic violence. This is the greatest threat to the  democratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and  Eurasia, even more than economic deprivation. We fully support the efforts of  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe , the Western European Union , the  Commonwealth of Independent States  and other competent regional  organizations to develop peace keeping capabilities.  We are convinced, however, that enhanced United Nations capabilities are  a necessary complement to these regional efforts, not just in Europe and  Eurasia, but across the globe.  I welcome the Secretary General call for a new agenda to strengthen the  ability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across  the globe. Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to  advance that agenda. I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the  merits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the  Secretary General proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key  areas.  First, robust peace keeping requires men and equipment that only Member  States can provide. Nations should develop and train military units for  possible peace keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces  must be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and  with the approval, of course, of the Governments providing it.  Secondly, if multinational units are to work together, they must train  together. Many nations for example, Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have  a long history of peace keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we  train for expanded operations. Effective multinational action will also  require coordinated command and control and inter operability of both  equipment and communications. Multinational planning, training, field   exercises will be needed. Those efforts should link up with regional  organizations.  Thirdly, we also need to provide adequate logistical support for  peace keeping and humanitarian operations. Member States should designate  stockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies, including  famines, floods and civil disturbances. This will save valuable time in a  crisis.  Fourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and  intelligence capabilities for peace keeping and humanitarian operations.  Fifthly, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations  and associated peace keeping efforts.  As I said, we must change our national institutions if we are to change  our international relations. So let me assure you that the United States is  ready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international  peace keeping.  For decades, the American military has served as a stabilizing presence  around the globe. And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning  wars, in keeping the peace, to support United Nations peace keeping. I have  directed the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on  peace keeping. Because of peace keeping growing importance as a mission for  the United States military, we will emphasize training of combat, engineering  and logistical units for the full range of peace keeping and humanitarian  activities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our  considerable lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to  support peace keeping operations. And we will offer our capabilities for  joint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint  peace keeping operations.   There is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will  play a part.  Member States, as always, must retain the final decision on the use of  their troops, of course. But we must develop our ability to coordinate  peace keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace  arises or when people in need look to the world for help.  I have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace keeping  curriculum in United States military schools. Training, plainly, is a key  element. The United States is prepared to make available our bases and  facilities for multinational training and field exercises. One such base,  nearby, with facilities is Fort Dix. America used these bases to win the cold  war and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace.  The United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the  United Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and  operations for peace keeping, and we will also broaden American support for  monitoring, verification, reconnaissance and other requirements of United  Nations peace keeping or humanitarian assistance operations.  And, finally, the United States will review how we fund peace keeping and  explore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United  Nations peace keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities. I do  believe that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our  security in this new era.  While the cold war may have ended, the super Power nuclear arms  competition, regional competition, weapons of mass destruction continue. Over  20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons  and the means to deliver them. At a time when the United States and its  former adversaries are engaged in deep, historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals,  our children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and  unstable nuclear stand offs to develop around the world.   We believe the Security Council should become a key forum for  non proliferation enforcement. The Security Council should make clear its  intention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators. Reaffirming  assurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear  Weapons was negotiated, I propose that the Security Council reassure the  non nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance,  in accordance with the Charter, to any any non nuclear weapon State party to  the non proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an  object of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons.  I also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non proliferation  Treaty when it is reviewed in 1995. I believe we must explore ways we can  strengthen linkages between the suppliers clubs, the nuclear suppliers  group, the Australia Group, the missile technology control regime and United  Nations specialized agencies.  Here I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations  Special Commission  to dismantle the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction  programme, and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy  Agency . But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop  proliferation, so too must every Member State change its structures to advance  our non proliferation goals.  In that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the  United States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and  Disarmament Agency  to refocus its talents on providing technical  support for non proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global  defence conversion. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, ACDA   should be used not only in completing the traditional arms control agenda but,  just as importantly, in providing technical assistance on our new security  agenda.  Even as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,  we must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already  taking place. Therefore, we are working towards a cooperative system for  defence against limited ballistic missile attacks. We fully intend to have  other nations participate in this global protection system.  While expanded peace keeping capabilities and improved non proliferation  efforts will be critical for building an enduring peace, shared economic  growth is the long term foundation for a brighter future well into the next  century. That is why I stated yesterday, during a moment of international  uncertainty, that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global  partners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for  this new era.  At the same time, I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to  examine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven  coordination process, and  I affirmed America support for a European integration that opens markets and  enhances Europe capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we  face in this new era. While the exact form of integration is, of course, for  Europeans to determine, we will stand by them.  Economic growth is not a zero sum process. All of us will benefit from  the expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world  economy. To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared  by all, fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic   engine. That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of  the negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  as  soon as possible, and to create a network of free trade agreements, beginning  with the North American Free Trade Agreement.  At the same time, we need to recognize that we have a shared  responsibility to foster and support the free market reforms necessary to  build growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in  the new democratic States. This should be done by promoting the private  sector to build these new economies, not by fostering dependency with  traditional Government to Government foreign aid.  After the Second World War, foreign assistance often served as a weapon  in the cold war. Obviously, we will still use critical foreign assistance  funds to meet legitimate security needs. And, as our humanitarian operations  in Somalia and northern Iraq, Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify,  we will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those  suffering from man made and natural disasters.  But foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed. The notion  of the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation  and mutually productive economic relationships. We know this: the more a  nation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of  growth; the more open to trade it is, the higher its rate of growth; and the  better a country investment climate, the higher its rate of growth.  To move from what I would call aid dependency to economic partnership, we  propose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance  programmes to building strong, independent economies that can become   contributors to a healthy, growing global economy. That means that our new  emphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors  that will promote prosperity at home, and abroad also. Working with our  Congress I will propose a top to bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan  and administer foreign assistance, drastically reducing the bureaucracy that  has built up around Government based programmes, streamlining our delivery  systems and strengthening support for private sector development and economic  reform.  The Agency for International Development , another institution born  during the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled.  Promoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a  primary mission of the State Department. Our assistance efforts should not be  charity. On the contrary, they should promote mutual prosperity. Therefore,  using existing foreign affairs resources, I will propose creating a $1 billion  growth fund. The fund will provide grants and credits to support United  States businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately  needed in countries undertaking economic restructuring.  I will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the  Export Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology  promote investment in world wide economic growth.  The United States will work with its global partners, especially the G 7  nations, to enhance global growth at this key point in world history, as we  end one era and begin another.  None of us can afford insular policies. Each of us must contribute,  through greater coordinated action, to building ¬£ stronger world economy.   I realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda. But we  live in remarkable times: times when empires collapse, ideologies dissolve  and walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget  how far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global  community of democratic nations.   And in the face of today changes, with the loss of so much that was  familiar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people  everywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against  trade, walls against people, walls against ideas and investment, walls against  anything at all that appears new and different.  As the Berlin Wall fell, these walls too must fall. They must fall  because we cannot separate our fate from that of others. Our peace is so  interconnected, our security so intertwined, our prosperity so interdependent,  that to turn inward and retreat from the world is to invite disaster and  defeat.  At the threshold of a new century we can truly say a more peaceful, more  secure, more prosperous future beckons to us. For the sake of our children  and our grandchildren, for the sake of those who perished during the cold war  and for the sake of every man, woman and child who kept freedom flame alive  even during the darkest noon, let us pledge ourselves to make that future  real, and let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United  Nations.

and,  like thousands of others of my generation, I had gone off to war to help keep  freedom alive',\n"," ' Forty seven years ago this month the war was finally over, and  I was looking forward to peace and the chance to begin my life in earnest:  1945 marked a moment of promise, not just for me, but for all of mankind',\n"," ' A  great struggle against dictatorship had been fought and won',\n"," ' Across the  globe, we all looked forward to a future free of war, a world where we might  raise our children in peace and freedom, and this institution, the United  Nations, born amidst the ashes of war, embodied those hopes and dreams like no  other',\n"," '  But the hopes and dreams of 1945 remained unfulfilled: communist  imperialism divided the world in two, our hopes for peace and our dreams of  freedom were frozen in the grip of cold war, and, instead of finding a common  ground, we found ourselves at Ground Zero',\n"," ' Instead of living on Churchill  The President returned to the Chair',\n"," '   broad, sunlit uplands, millions found that there was, as Arthur Koestler so  chillingly wrote, Darkness at Noon',\n"," ' Instead of uniting the nations, this  body became a forum for distrust and division among nations and, in a cruel  irony, the United Nations, created to free the world of conflict, itself  became conflict captive',\n"," '  I too lived through those disputes; I sat where you sit, proudly so; I  served in this Assembly and I saw, in my time, the consequences of the cold  war hot words on the higher missions of the United Nations',\n"," ' Now, 47 years  later, we stand at the end of another war, the cold war, and our hopes and  dreams have awakened again',\n"," \" Driven by its own internal contradictions and  banished by the peoples' undying thirst for freedom, imperial communism has  collapsed in its birthplace, and today Russia has awakened democratic,  independent and free; the Baltic States are free; and so too are Ukraine,  Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other independent States joining the  nations of Central and Eastern Europe in freedom\",\n"," '  The fear of nuclear Armageddon between the super Powers has vanished, and  we are proud to have done our part to ensure that our schoolchildren do not  have to practise hiding under their desks for fear of nuclear attack, as the  generation before them did',\n"," ' I am proud also to salute the courageous leaders  with nuclear responsibilities Presidents Yeltsin, Kravchuk, Nazarbayev,  Shushkevich who joined me in ending the super Power stand off that risked  nuclear nightmare',\n"," ' This is the first General Assembly session to seat you as  truly independent and free nations, and to you and the leaders of the other  independent States, I say welcome home: we are now truly united nations',\n"," '   With the cold war end, I believe we have a unique opportunity to go  beyond artificial divisions of a first, second and third world to forge  instead a genuine, global community of free and sovereign nations, a community  built on respect for principle, on peaceful settlement of disputes, on  fundamental human rights and on the twin pillars of freedom: democracy and  free markets',\n"," ' Already, the United Nations, especially the Security Council,  has done much to fulfil its original mission and to build this global  community',\n"," '  United Nations leadership has been critical in resolving conflicts and  brokering peace the entire world over, but securing democracy and securing the  peace in the century ahead will be no simple task',\n"," ' Imperial communism may  have been vanquished, but that does not end the challenges of our age,  challenges that must be overcome if we are finally to end the divisions  between East and West, North and South, that fuel strife and strain and  conflict and war',\n"," '  As we support the historic growth of democracy around the world, I  believe the community of nations and the United Nations face three critical,  interrelated challenges as we enter the twenty first century',\n"," '  First, we face the political challenge of keeping today peace and  preventing tomorrow wars',\n"," ' As we see daily in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia,  everywhere conflict claims innocent lives; the need for enhanced peace keeping  capabilities has never been greater; the conflicts we must deal with have  never been more intractable, the costs of conflict higher',\n"," '  Second, we face the strategic challenge of the proliferation of weapons  of mass destruction, truly the fastest growing security challenge to  international peace and order',\n"," '   Third, we face the common economic challenge of promoting prosperity for  all, of strengthening an open, growth oriented, free market international  economic order while safeguarding the environment',\n"," '  Meeting these challenges will require us to strengthen our collective  engagement; it will require us to transform our collective institutions; and,  above all, it will require that each of us look seriously at our own  Government and how we conduct our international affairs',\n"," ' We too must change  our institutions and our practices if we are to make a new world of the  promises of today, if we are to secure a twenty first century peace',\n"," '  With you today I would like to discuss these three challenges:  peace keeping, proliferation and prosperity',\n"," ' And I should like to use this  opportunity to begin to sketch how I believe the international community can  work together to meet these three challenges and how the United States is  changing its institutions and policies to catalyze this effort',\n"," '  Let me begin with peace keeping',\n"," ' The United Nations has a long and  distinguished history of peace keeping and humanitarian relief',\n"," ' From Cyprus  and Lebanon, to Cambodia and Croatia, the blue beret has become a symbol of  hope amid all that hostility',\n"," ' And the United Nations has long played a  central role in preventing conflicts from turning into wars, and strengthening  peace keeping capabilities can help buttress these diplomatic efforts',\n"," ' But,  as much as the United Nations has done, it can do much more',\n"," '  Peace keepers are stretched to the limit while the demands for their  services increase by the day',\n"," ' The need for monitoring and preventive  peace keeping putting people on the ground before the fighting starts   may  become especially critical in volatile regions',\n"," ' This is especially the case  because of the rapid and turbulent change that continues to shake Eastern  Europe and Eurasia',\n"," ' Across the lands that once were imprisoned behind an iron  curtain, peoples are reasserting their historical identities that were frozen  in communism catacomb',\n"," '  Where this is taking place in a democratic manner with tolerance and  civility and respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms, this new  democratic nationalism is all to the good',\n"," ' But, unfortunately, we need only  look to the bloody battles raging in places such as the former Yugoslavia to  see the dangers of ethnic violence',\n"," ' This is the greatest threat to the  democratic peace we hope to build with Eastern Europe, with Russia and  Eurasia, even more than economic deprivation',\n"," ' We fully support the efforts of  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe , the Western European Union , the  Commonwealth of Independent States  and other competent regional  organizations to develop peace keeping capabilities',\n"," '  We are convinced, however, that enhanced United Nations capabilities are  a necessary complement to these regional efforts, not just in Europe and  Eurasia, but across the globe',\n"," '  I welcome the Secretary General call for a new agenda to strengthen the  ability of the United Nations to prevent, contain and resolve conflicts across  the globe',\n"," ' Today I call upon all Members to join me in taking bold steps to  advance that agenda',\n"," ' I will therefore be discussing with my colleagues the  merits of a special meeting of the Security Council to discuss the  Secretary General proposals and to develop concrete responses in five key  areas',\n"," '  First, robust peace keeping requires men and equipment that only Member  States can provide',\n"," ' Nations should develop and train military units for  possible peace keeping operations and humanitarian relief and these forces  must be available on short notice at the request of the Security Council and  with the approval, of course, of the Governments providing it',\n"," '  Secondly, if multinational units are to work together, they must train  together',\n"," ' Many nations for example, Fiji, Norway, Canada and Finland have  a long history of peace keeping and we can all tap into that experience as we  train for expanded operations',\n"," ' Effective multinational action will also  require coordinated command and control and inter operability of both  equipment and communications',\n"," ' Multinational planning, training, field   exercises will be needed',\n"," ' Those efforts should link up with regional  organizations',\n"," '  Thirdly, we also need to provide adequate logistical support for  peace keeping and humanitarian operations',\n"," ' Member States should designate  stockpiles of resources necessary to meet humanitarian emergencies, including  famines, floods and civil disturbances',\n"," ' This will save valuable time in a  crisis',\n"," '  Fourthly, we will need to develop planning, crisis management and  intelligence capabilities for peace keeping and humanitarian operations',\n"," '  Fifthly, we must ensure adequate equitable financing for United Nations  and associated peace keeping efforts',\n"," '  As I said, we must change our national institutions if we are to change  our international relations',\n"," ' So let me assure you that the United States is  ready to do its part to strengthen world peace by strengthening international  peace keeping',\n"," '  For decades, the American military has served as a stabilizing presence  around the globe',\n"," ' And I want to draw on our extensive experience in winning  wars, in keeping the peace, to support United Nations peace keeping',\n"," ' I have  directed the United States Secretary of Defense to place a new emphasis on  peace keeping',\n"," ' Because of peace keeping growing importance as a mission for  the United States military, we will emphasize training of combat, engineering  and logistical units for the full range of peace keeping and humanitarian  activities and we will work with the United Nations to best employ our  considerable lift, logistics, communications and intelligence capabilities to  support peace keeping operations',\n"," ' And we will offer our capabilities for  joint simulations and exercises to strengthen our ability to undertake joint  peace keeping operations',\n"," '   There is room for all countries, large and small, and I hope all will  play a part',\n"," '  Member States, as always, must retain the final decision on the use of  their troops, of course',\n"," ' But we must develop our ability to coordinate  peace keeping efforts so that we can mobilize quickly when a threat to peace  arises or when people in need look to the world for help',\n"," '  I have further directed the establishment of a permanent peace keeping  curriculum in United States military schools',\n"," ' Training, plainly, is a key  element',\n"," ' The United States is prepared to make available our bases and  facilities for multinational training and field exercises',\n"," ' One such base,  nearby, with facilities is Fort Dix',\n"," ' America used these bases to win the cold  war and today, with that war over, they can help build a lasting peace',\n"," '  The United States is willing to provide our military expertise to the  United Nations to help the United Nations strengthen its planning and  operations for peace keeping, and we will also broaden American support for  monitoring, verification, reconnaissance and other requirements of United  Nations peace keeping or humanitarian assistance operations',\n"," '  And, finally, the United States will review how we fund peace keeping and  explore new ways to ensure adequate American financial support for United  Nations peace keeping and United Nations humanitarian activities',\n"," ' I do  believe that we must think differently about how we ensure and pay for our  security in this new era',\n"," '  While the cold war may have ended, the super Power nuclear arms  competition, regional competition, weapons of mass destruction continue',\n"," ' Over  20 countries have, or are developing, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons  and the means to deliver them',\n"," ' At a time when the United States and its  former adversaries are engaged in deep, historic cuts in our nuclear arsenals,  our children and grandchildren will never forgive us if we allow new and  unstable nuclear stand offs to develop around the world',\n"," '   We believe the Security Council should become a key forum for  non proliferation enforcement',\n"," ' The Security Council should make clear its  intention to stem proliferation and sanction proliferators',\n"," ' Reaffirming  assurances made at the time the Treaty on the Non Proliferation of Nuclear  Weapons was negotiated, I propose that the Security Council reassure the  non nuclear States that it will seek immediate action to provide assistance,  in accordance with the Charter, to any any non nuclear weapon State party to  the non proliferation Treaty that is a victim of an act of aggression or an  object of threat of aggression involving nuclear weapons',\n"," '  I also call for the indefinite renewal of the nuclear non proliferation  Treaty when it is reviewed in 1995',\n"," ' I believe we must explore ways we can  strengthen linkages between the suppliers clubs, the nuclear suppliers  group, the Australia Group, the missile technology control regime and United  Nations specialized agencies',\n"," '  Here I would like to note the productive efforts of the United Nations  Special Commission  to dismantle the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction  programme, and the continuing good work of the International Atomic Energy  Agency ',\n"," ' But as the United Nations organizations adapt to stop  proliferation, so too must every Member State change its structures to advance  our non proliferation goals',\n"," '  In that spirit I want today to announce my intention to work with the  United States Congress to redirect the United States Arms Control and  Disarmament Agency  to refocus its talents on providing technical  support for non proliferation, weapons monitoring and destruction, and global  defence conversion',\n"," ' Under the direction of the Secretary of State, ACDA   should be used not only in completing the traditional arms control agenda but,  just as importantly, in providing technical assistance on our new security  agenda',\n"," '  Even as we work to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,  we must be realistic and guard ourselves against proliferation that is already  taking place',\n"," ' Therefore, we are working towards a cooperative system for  defence against limited ballistic missile attacks',\n"," ' We fully intend to have  other nations participate in this global protection system',\n"," '  While expanded peace keeping capabilities and improved non proliferation  efforts will be critical for building an enduring peace, shared economic  growth is the long term foundation for a brighter future well into the next  century',\n"," ' That is why I stated yesterday, during a moment of international  uncertainty, that the United States would be strongly engaged with its global  partners in building a global economic, financial and trading structure for  this new era',\n"," '  At the same time, I urged that our global responsibilities lead us to  examine ways to strengthen the Group of Seven  coordination process, and  I affirmed America support for a European integration that opens markets and  enhances Europe capability to be our partner in the great challenges that we  face in this new era',\n"," ' While the exact form of integration is, of course, for  Europeans to determine, we will stand by them',\n"," '  Economic growth is not a zero sum process',\n"," ' All of us will benefit from  the expanded trade and investment that comes from a vibrant, growing world  economy',\n"," ' To ensure that the benefits of this growth are sustained and shared  by all, fair and open competition should be the fuel for the global economic   engine',\n"," ' That is why the United States wants to complete the Uruguay Round of  the negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  as  soon as possible, and to create a network of free trade agreements, beginning  with the North American Free Trade Agreement',\n"," '  At the same time, we need to recognize that we have a shared  responsibility to foster and support the free market reforms necessary to  build growing economies and vibrant democracies in the developing world and in  the new democratic States',\n"," ' This should be done by promoting the private  sector to build these new economies, not by fostering dependency with  traditional Government to Government foreign aid',\n"," '  After the Second World War, foreign assistance often served as a weapon  in the cold war',\n"," ' Obviously, we will still use critical foreign assistance  funds to meet legitimate security needs',\n"," ' And, as our humanitarian operations  in Somalia and northern Iraq, Bosnia and the former Soviet Union will testify,  we will continue our robust humanitarian assistance efforts to help those  suffering from man made and natural disasters',\n"," '  But foreign aid as we have known it needs to be transformed',\n"," ' The notion  of the handout to less developed countries needs to give way to cooperation  and mutually productive economic relationships',\n"," ' We know this: the more a  nation relies on the private sector and free markets, the higher its rate of  growth; the more open to trade it is, the higher its rate of growth; and the  better a country investment climate, the higher its rate of growth',\n"," '  To move from what I would call aid dependency to economic partnership, we  propose to alter fundamentally the focus of United States assistance  programmes to building strong, independent economies that can become   contributors to a healthy, growing global economy',\n"," ' That means that our new  emphasis should be on building economic partnerships among our private sectors  that will promote prosperity at home, and abroad also',\n"," ' Working with our  Congress I will propose a top to bottom overhaul of our institutions that plan  and administer foreign assistance, drastically reducing the bureaucracy that  has built up around Government based programmes, streamlining our delivery  systems and strengthening support for private sector development and economic  reform',\n"," '  The Agency for International Development , another institution born  during the cold war, needs to be fundamentally and radically overhauled',\n"," '  Promoting economic security, opportunity and competitiveness will become a  primary mission of the State Department',\n"," ' Our assistance efforts should not be  charity',\n"," ' On the contrary, they should promote mutual prosperity',\n"," ' Therefore,  using existing foreign affairs resources, I will propose creating a $1 billion  growth fund',\n"," ' The fund will provide grants and credits to support United  States businesses in providing expertise, goods and services desperately  needed in countries undertaking economic restructuring',\n"," '  I will also support significantly increasing the programmes of the  Export Import Bank to ensure that United States products and technology  promote investment in world wide economic growth',\n"," '  The United States will work with its global partners, especially the G 7  nations, to enhance global growth at this key point in world history, as we  end one era and begin another',\n"," '  None of us can afford insular policies',\n"," ' Each of us must contribute,  through greater coordinated action, to building ¬£ stronger world economy',\n"," '   I realize that what I have outlined today is an ambitious agenda',\n"," ' But we  live in remarkable times: times when empires collapse, ideologies dissolve  and walls crumble; times when change can come so fast that we sometimes forget  how far and how fast we have progressed in achieving our hopes for a global  community of democratic nations',\n"," '   And in the face of today changes, with the loss of so much that was  familiar and predictable, there is now a great temptation for people  everywhere to turn inward and to build walls around themselves walls against  trade, walls against people, walls against ideas and investment, walls against  anything at all that appears new and different',\n"," '  As the Berlin Wall fell, these walls too must fall',\n"," ' They must fall  because we cannot separate our fate from that of others',\n"," ' Our peace is so  interconnected, our security so intertwined, our prosperity so interdependent,  that to turn inward and retreat from the world is to invite disaster and  defeat',\n"," '  At the threshold of a new century we can truly say a more peaceful, more  secure, more prosperous future beckons to us',\n"," ' For the sake of our children  and our grandchildren, for the sake of those who perished during the cold war  and for the sake of every man, woman and child who kept freedom flame alive  even during the darkest noon, let us pledge ourselves to make that future  real, and let us pledge ourselves to fulfil the promise of a truly United  Nations',\n"," '  Thank you and may God bless you all',\n"," '

invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programmes like the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the President’s Malaria Initiative, the Global Health Security

deserve',\n"," ' Though still in its infancy, the North American Free Trade Agreement has dramatically increased trade between the United States and Mexico and has produced in the United States alone

initiative of June, have committed themselves to carry out that resolution in all its parts',\n"," ' Already the plans for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in 1972 have begun to take shape and have helped to focus the attention of United Nations Member Governments on this worldwide challenge; but we should not wait for the Stockholm Conference before launching necessary initiatives',\n"," ' We should ensure that the functions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development do not duplicate those of the new World Trade Organization , and we should adopt a
