heat transfer into one side of a flat plate, representing a thick skin, and the effect of the resulting temperature distribution in inducing thermal stresses associated with bending restraint at the plate edges . numerical results are presented for the transient temperature differentials in the plate when the environment temperature first increases linearly with time and then remains constant, the period of linear increase representing the time of acceleration of the aircraft .  corresponding thermal stress information is presented .   the second case is that of the wide-flanged i-beam with convective heat transfer into the outer faces of the flanges .  numerical results are presented for transient temperature differentials for a wide range of values of the applicable parameters and for an environment temperature variation as described above . corresponding thermal stresses in a beam of infinite length are determined .  a theoretical analysis of the stress distribution in a beam of finite length is carried out and numerical results obtained for one case .  an experimental investigation of temperatures and stresses in such a beam is described, and results are presented which indicate good agreement with corresponding theoretical results .',\n","       'thermal buckling of supersonic wing panels .   the temperature and thermal stress distributions are analyzed in multicellular supersonic wing structures .  a buckling criterion is established for the panels of cover plates subjected to thermal stresses .',\n","       'the dynamic motion of a missile descending through the atmosphere .   a method is presented for computing rapidly, yet accurately, the dynamic motion of a ballistic-type missile descending through the atmosphere .  the equations of motion are separated into a set of /static/ trajectory equations (zero angle of attack) and a set of /rotational/ equations describing the oscillatory motion of the missile about its center of gravity .  a transformation allows the rotational equations to be written in a manner analogous to the equation for an undamped oscillating spring mass system with the mass equal to unity and a time variable spring constant .  for given initial conditions this equation can be solved to obtain the envelope of maximum angle of attack .  an additional transformation allows the calculation of the complete oscillatory motion at any time during the trajectory as a function of the maximum angle of attack at that time .   this solution shows that the maximum angle of attack of a missile descending through the atmosphere at relatively constant speed is reduced even when the aerodynamic damping is neglected .',\n","       'on the flow of a sonic stream past an airfoil surface .   this study of the flow about an airfoil in a near-sonic stream indicates the important factors determining the pressure distribution on the airfoil .  analysis of the mach wave pattern suggests that the supersonic domain of the flow can be derived from two simple-wave flows, one arising from the mach waves reflected at the sonic line and the other from the changes in airfoil surface slope .  the compressive effect of the reflected mach waves is determined quantitatively as a function of airfoil leading-edge geometry from an analysis of measured pressure distributions for uncambered airfoils,. and it is shown how this can be superimposed on the wave system from the curved surface to give an equivalent simple-wave flow over the airfoil .   an application of this scheme to the calculation of the pressure distribution over an airfoil in a sonic stream gives results in good agreement with experiment .',\n","       'experiments on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds .   tests were conducted in the 12-in. continuous supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory, california institute of technology, to determine the effects of surface cooling on boundary-layer transition at supersonic speeds .  the effects of cooling were investigated at test section mach numbers of 1.97, smooth cone in the presence of three levels of supply-stream turbulence (0.4, 2, and 9 per cent) and several single-element roughnesses at fixed axial location .  transition data were obtained optically by means of a magnified-schlieren system .  the results, for the range of mach number investigated, indicate that (1) transition on a smooth cone can definitely be delayed by surface cooling, (2) transition promoted by either supply-stream turbulence or surface roughness can also be delayed by surface cooling depending upon degree of turbulence or relative roughness respectively, and (3) the adverse effects of increased turbulence and roughness decrease with increasing mach number .'],\n","
